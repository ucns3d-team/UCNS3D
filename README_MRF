This document describes how to run a Multiple Reference Frame simulation on UCNS3D solver. The files for this tutorial are located in the Cranfield University repository Cord  (https://cord.cranfield.ac.uk/)


## Setup
 
The file ROTFRAME.dat contains the inputs used by the solver on the simulation. It includes the flag for the rotational reference frame, axis origin, rotational velocity, rotational peridiocity flag, periodic angle, reference velocity (tip blade velocity), number of rotors and points and radius  of the MRF domain. 


The test cases consists of four helicopter cases: 

* Caradonna and Tung (out of ground effect): The mesh files and results of the test case from section 4 used on the publication "Hovering rotor solutions by high-order methods on unstructured grids" (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ast.2019.105648)  can be download from (https://figshare.com/s/616cc1b31e4cda09ac2c).

* Paint Sensitive Pressure rotor (out of ground effect): The periodic mesh files and results of the test case from section 5 used on the publication "Hovering rotor solutions by high-order methods on unstructured grids" (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ast.2019.105648)  can be download from (https://figshare.com/s/616cc1b31e4cda09ac2c).

* `Black Hawk` UH-60a (out of ground effect): The periodic mesh files and results of the test case from section 6 used on the publication "Hovering rotor solutions by high-order methods on unstructured grids" (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ast.2019.105648)  can be download from (https://figshare.com/s/616cc1b31e4cda09ac2c).

* Caradonna and Tung (with and without ground effect): The mesh files and results of the test case used on the publication "Simple multiple reference frame for high-order solution of hovering rotors with and without ground effect" (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ast.2021.106518)  can be download from (https://doi.org/10.17862/cranfield.rd.c.5284412.v1).

* S-76 (with and without ground effect): The mesh files and results of the test case used on the publication "Simple multiple reference frame for high-order solution of hovering rotors with and without ground effect" (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ast.2021.106518)  can be download from (https://doi.org/10.17862/cranfield.rd.c.5284412.v1).

* Paint Sensitive Pressure full-helicopter (with and without ground effect): The periodic mesh files and results of the test case from section 5 used on the publication "Numerical Investigation of full helicopter with and without the ground effect"  can be download from (https://doi.org/10.17862/cranfield.rd.c.5830823). The unstructured Blade grid can be downloaded at (https://www.aiaa-hpw.org/psp-rotor), the robin fuselage geometry can be also downloaded at (https://github.com/Applied-Scientific-Research/robin-surface-mesh), but the coefficients have to be accordingly to (https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20100033120) to generate the mod7 geometry.


## Running and post processing the Simulation

The detail for running the simulation are provided on instructions given at (https://github.com/ucns3d-team/UCNS3D)
