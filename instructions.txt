Instruction

On Pointwise you will have two periodic interface:
the "positive" and the "negative" in respect to x. The positive have an angle < respect to the negative.

When you export the fluent.msh file you have to open it and search for the word "interface":
you will see two matches:

if the match is the "negative interface" change the line:
(0 "Zone 7 4868 faces 4066400..4071267, BC: negative interface = 24")
(13 (7 3e0c60 3e1f63 18 0)(

into 

(0 "Zone 7 4868 faces 4066400..4071267, BC: negative interface = 24")
(13 (7 3e0c60 3e1f63 80 0)(


so you have changed the code "18" into "80"


if the match is the "positive interface"

(0 "Zone 8 4868 faces 4071268..4076135, BC: positive interface = 24")
(13 (8 3e1f64 3e3267 18 0)(

change into 

(0 "Zone 8 4868 faces 4071268..4076135, BC: positive interface = 24")
(13 (8 3e1f64 3e3267 8 0)(

so from "18" to "8".

This was made so the code knows what is the positive and the negative interface that must be rotated of theta or -theta.

In the ROTFRAME.dat there are two  parameters:
!Periodic: 1: ACTIVE  0: DEACTIVE |\| Angle: (deg) |\| Reference Velocity: (WxR) 
1 180.0   

where the second are the degrees (180.0 for caradonna(2blades), 90.0 for psp and uh-60 (4blades) and so on) the tolerance for the procedure that associates the periodic neighours is 10e-8.
Uou can try different value changing TOL_PER on parameters.f90 but it should not give any problem. however if there are problem the simulation will crash immediately so you will know about that.

Use 7 as limiter.
