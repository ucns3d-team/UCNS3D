You need only the following files in a directory to run the simulation:

1) GRID.cel, GRID.bnd, GRID.vrt (grid files)
2) ucns3d_p                     (executable)
3) UCNS3D.DAT                   (parameter file)


If the RESTART file is present in the directory the code will automatically restart from this checkpoint file,
(so it should be removed for the sake of benchmarking), the same applies for the *.vtk files and the 
STATS_..... files.


The UCNS3D.DAT parameter that controls the order of accuracy should be varied from 3 (currently in the UCNS3D.DAT file
