 A series of test problems are provided for the user to test.
 
 Representative tests can be downloaded from 
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3375432
 
These include 2D, and 3D test problems using Linear Advection, Euler, Navier-Stokes and RANS equations.

All the directories include the grid files (MESHES), the pointwise files for generating the meshes, 
the parameter files UCNS3D.DAT (DATS), and sample run directories with some representative outputs.


It has to be noted that for each test problem a different initial condition is used, and the user should 
start using the configurations of the parameter file UCNS3D.DAT provided prior to changing any of the variables 
to ensure that the code runs as intended.
